/// time points parametrized over the time interval [0,1]. An initial phase uses the AABB tree to
/// select a set of potentially colliding segments from the SegmentMesh. For each of these
/// candidate segment pairs, the goal is to determine the point of earliest contact should any exist.
///
/// At the highest level the actual collision detection of candidate segment pairs is a two phase
/// algorithm. First determine if there is contact at the start of an interval and report the contact if
/// found. If no contact is found at the start, subdivide the interval, determine which of the resulting
/// candidate subintervals may have collisions, and then recursively check those promising subintervals.
/// Note that a simple algorithm based on interval arithmetic (including the Interval, LinearMotion and
/// Polynomial interval classes) allows for a quick determination of promising subintervals allowing many
/// of the subintervals to be pruned during the subdivision step without forcing the recursion to bottom out.
